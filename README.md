# VaporWebInterface
This web interface is designed to interact with the VaporAPI, with an online game store (i.e. Steam) in mind. 
This project was developed for CPSC 471 at the University of Calgary during the Winter 2022 term.

This web interface is not fully functional, nor is it well-secured, as this is a developmental project/homework assignment.
The associated API can be found at https://github.com/BenjaminMacKay/VaporAPI
